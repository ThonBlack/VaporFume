const { db } = require('./src/db/db'); // We might need to adjust imports for standalone script, usually we use require for scripts
// Actually, `src/db/db` uses ES modules (import). We can't easily mix require/import without "type": "module" in package.json.
// Next.js handles this, but a standalone script might be tricky.
// Better approach: Create a Next.js API Route `/api/cron/process-queue` and `/api/cron/generate-winback` 
// and use `cron` on the VPS to hit these endpoints via curl.

// HOWEVER, the user likes "Automations".
// Let's try to stick to a node script if possible, or use the existing "scheduler.js" pattern if one exists.
// Checking file list... no scheduler.js.

// Let's use the API Route approach which is standard for Next.js.
// 1. /api/cron/winback -> Generates the queue items for the day.
// 2. /api/cron/process -> Process pending items (e.g. called every 5 mins).

// Wait, user said "distribuis isso durante o dia".
// If we generate them at 9 AM and allow the queue processor to pick them up when `scheduledAt` is reached.
